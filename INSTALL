REQUIREMENTS
------------

OIP requires several components:
- Java runtime environment (minimal 1.5)
- a Java web application server like Apache Tomcat (5.5.27)
- MySQL database (5.1) or other database supported by MMBase like PostgreSQL.
- FFmpeg (0.5) for audio and video transcoding
- FFmpeg2Theora (*)
- ImageMagick or JAI for image conversions (**)

(*)  Is not really needed, but is configured. FFmpeg should be able to do all transcodings.
(**) Depending on you system is JAI easier to install, but ImageMAgick offers more options.


INSTALLATION
------------
Refer to the MMBase installation documentation: 
http://www.mmbase.org/mmdocs/releases/installation.txt

Note about the Lucene search index:
You may have to run the Lucene search index for the first time by hand or the pages 'Media' 
and 'Users' may remain empty. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/mmbase/admin/lucene/admin - or the
equivalent url on your application server - and click "Full index on all indices" at the bottom of 
the page. This will create (new) search indexes based of all media and user data in your database.
