REQUIREMENTS
------------

OIP requires several components:
- Java runtime environment (minimal 1.5)
- Java web application server like Apache Tomcat (preferably > 5.5.27)
- MySQL database (5.1) or other database supported by MMBase like PostgreSQL, including the 
  appropriate JDBC driver.
- FFmpeg (0.5 or preferably a recent build from its repository) for audio and video transcoding
- FFmpeg2Theora (*)
- ImageMagick or JAI for image conversions (**)
- JavaMail to send mail (***)

(*)   Is not really needed. OIP is currently configured to use FFmpeg2Theora for transcoding Ogg media.
      FFmpeg does the rest. You can configure OIP to use FFmpeg for Ogg and not use FFmpge2Theora.
(**)  Depending on your system is JAI easier to install, but ImageMagick offers more options.
(***) Java 1.5 requires the Java Activation Framework (JAF) API for JavaMail. You will then need
      both 'mail.jar' and 'activation.jar'. Java 1.6 includes JAF.


INSTALLATION
------------
OIP is a Java web application that is based upon MMBase, for more detailed information about 
installing web applications refer to your server's documentation or the MMBase installation
documentation: http://www.mmbase.org/mmdocs/releases/installation.txt

OIP's war is configured to be able to run right away using a HSQL database:

1. Copy the downloaded oip-1.1.war file to you Java web application servers (f.e. Tomcat) webapps 
   directory.
2. Start your web application server, wait a minute for the server to complete deploying OIP.
3. Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/oip-1.1.


For a full installation with mail and a more persistant database like MySQL, follow these steps:

1. Install Java.
2. Install the Java web application server, for example Apache Tomcat. 
   Run the server and make sure it works by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080 -
   depending on your configuration.
3. Install a database server and the appropriate jdbc driver.
   Other types of databases are possible, but OIP was developed using MySQL. For MySQL: 
   a. Create a database 'oip': 
      CREATE DATABASE oip;
   b. Give the application the appropriate login credentials:
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oip.* TO mmbase@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "admin2k";
   c. Install a MySQL jdbc driver/connector in your application server. 
      For Apache Tomcat 5 it should be in '[catalina-home]/common/lib' and for Apache Tomcat 6 in
      '[catalina-home]/lib'.
4. Install JavaMail: 'mail.jar' (and 'activation.jar' for Java < 1.5). These should typically be 
   in the same directory as the jdbc driver. 
5. Place the 'oip-1.1.war' in your servers webapps directory and start the server.
   Wait a minute or two while the war deploys. Needed tables and some example content are 
   automatically created in the 'oip' database.
   A configuration file with the most important settings can now be found in servers configuration 
   directory, in Tomcat that will probably be '[catalina-home]/conf/Catalina/localhost/oip-1.1.xml'
   for database settings, logging etc. Other configuration options are found in the 'WEB-INF/config' 
   directory of oip-1.1.
6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/oip-1.1 to make sure it runs. 
7. Login with 'admin' and 'openimages2009'. Or 'foofoo' and 'barbar' as a project manager.

When OIP is running allright, you may need to configure some other applications to enable the 
conversion of media, sending of mail etc.

8. Install FFmpeg. 
9. Install ImageMagick.

Note about the Lucene search index:
You may have to run the Lucene search index for the first time by hand or the pages 'Media' 
and 'Users' may remain empty. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/mmbase/admin/lucene/admin - or the
equivalent url on your application server - and click "Full index on all indices" at the bottom of 
the page. This will create (new) search indexes based of all media and user data in your database. 


CONFIGURATION
-------------
OIP is based on MMBase, uses FFmpeg and some other applications and is because of that highly
configurable.

What do you really need to configure?
-------------------------------------
* Security: visit '/mmbase/security/index.jsp' to change the admin password. 

* Media: creation of streams is configured in '/WEB-INF/config/createcaches.xml'.

* Email: the smtp server that is being used.
Edit the application context xml (f.e. '[catalina-home]/conf/Catalina/localhost/oip-1.1.xml').

What can be configured?
-----------------------
* Remote server transcodings, see '/WEB-INF/config/createcaches.xml'.
* Database. To use a different table, database etc. edit the context xml (f.e. 
  '[catalina-home]/conf/Catalina/localhost/oip-1.1.xml').
* User management, enable a user as project manager.


OIP ADMINISTRATION
------------------
* Security 
Users have different ranks. An administartor can alter all settings and access, edit and remove all
content. A normal account, an account that subscribes itself via the frontend - has rank 'site user'. 
These users have only access to content they create themselves. A user with rank 'project manager' 
- like the example user foofoo - can manage everything created by sites users.

* Editors
Managing media and site content 
http://localhost:8080/oip-1.1/editors

* MMBase
Main configuration and management of MMBase
http://localhost:8080/oip-1.1/mmbase

* Streams and media
http://127.0.0.1:8080/oip-1.1/mmbase/streams/streams/admin

* Lucene search indexes: 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/oip-1.1/mmbase/lucene/lucene/admin
