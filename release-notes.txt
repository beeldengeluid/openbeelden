Release Notes - Open Images Platform - Version OIP 1.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------

UPGRADING 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2
========================
New fields were added to the builders mediafragments, audiostreamsources, imagesources, 
streamsources, videostreamsources and mmbaseusers. Add these fields to your database. 
Default OIP is configured to use MySQL with views, other configurations or databases typically
need similar statements:

  ALTER TABLE oi_audiostreamsources_table ADD language CHAR(12);
  ALTER TABLE oi_imagesources_table ADD language CHAR(12);
  ALTER TABLE oi_streamsources_table ADD language CHAR(12);
  ALTER TABLE oi_videostreamsources_table ADD language CHAR(12);
  DROP VIEW oi_audiostreamsources;
  DROP VIEW oi_imagesources;
  DROP VIEW oi_streamsources;
  DROP VIEW oi_videostreamsources;

  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table ADD contributor VARCHAR(255);
  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table ADD dc_creator VARCHAR(255);
  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table ADD identifier VARCHAR(255);
  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table ADD relation TEXT;
  DROP VIEW oi_mediafragments;
  DROP VIEW oi_videofragments;
  DROP VIEW oi_audiofragments;
  DROP VIEW oi_imagefragments;

  ALTER TABLE oi_mmbaseusers_table ADD organisation BIT(1);
  DROP VIEW oi_mmbaseusers;


UPGRADING 1.0 -> 1.0.1
======================
The builder videosources has a new field to store audio codec, named 'acodec'. You will need
to add this field to your database before upgrading to 1.0.1 (from 1.0). 
In MySQL that would normally be:

  ALTER TABLE oi_videosources_table ADD acodec INTEGER(11);

When you have MySQL configured with views, do also:

  DROP VIEW oi_videosources;
  DROP VIEW oi_videostreamsources;
  DROP VIEW oi_videostreamsourcescaches;

This release is build with MMBase 1.9.4, its release notes:
